# World_Weather_Analysis
Python API Challenge

## Overview

Beta testers of a new app, PlanMyTrip, have offered suggestions to improve its functionality. They requested that the weather description is included in the weather data for each city. They would alos like to filter the data for their weather preferences. Finally, they would prefer to create a travel itinerary to 4 of the cities in their list.

## Deliverable 1

In this deliverable, a set of 2000 random latitudes and longitudes were generated. The nearest city to the coordinates was retreived, and the weather data was gathered by performing an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. 

## Deliverable 2

For this task, input statements were used to find out customers' weather preferences. Those inputs were used to find potential travel destinations and nearby hotels, which are easily identified by pop-up markers on an interactive map.

## Deliverable 3

Using Google Directions API, a travel itinerary was created to show the route between four cities chosen from the customer's travel destinations.
